🧮 GUI Calculator

A simple desktop calculator built with Java Swing.
The project is divided into three separate classes for clarity and structure:

Main — launches the application using SwingUtilities.invokeLater()

CalculatorUi — handles the graphical user interface and button actions

CalculatorLogic — performs arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) with divide-by-zero safety

Lightweight, responsive, and written entirely in pure Java.
